online version is https://svaaps.github.io/eaglercrafthtml/
(online version saves individual worlds too and works just as normal as the local version but you don't have to download anything)
if you wanna play eaglercraft locally like a weirdo, its in releases

you can also clone this to make your own copy of the web version of eaglercraft
